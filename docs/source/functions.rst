Supported functions
===================

In the following we list the elementary functions currently supported for use with jets.

These functions are characterized by the fact that their derivatives are known exactly
and can be easily computed up to any order.

.. automodule:: njet.functions
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :exclude-members: get_function, detect_code, jetfunc
