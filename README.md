# njet: Lightweight automatic differentiation

A lightweight AD package, using forward-mode automatic differentiation, in order to determine the
higher-order derivatives of a given function in several variables.

## Features

- Higher-order (forward-mode) automatic differentiation in several variables.
- Support for NumPy, SymPy and mpmath.
- Differentiation of expressions containing nested higher-order derivatives.
- Complex differentiation (Wirtinger calculus) possible.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Installation

Install this module with pip

```sh
pip install njet
```

## Quickstart

An example function we want to differentiate
```python
from njet.functions import exp
f = lambda x, y, z: exp(-0.23*x**2 - 0.33*x*y - 0.11*z**2)
```

Generate a class to handle the derivatives of the given function (here up to order 3)
```python
from njet import derive
df = derive(f, order=3)
```

Evaluate the derivatives at a specific point
```python
df([0.4, 2.1, 1.73])

The indices here correspond to the powers of the variables x, y, z
in the multivariate Taylor expansion. They can be translated to
the tensor indices of the corresponding multilinear map using a
built-in routine. Example:

Obtain the gradient and the Hessian
```python
df.grad()

{(2,): -0.2000425221825019,
 (0,): -0.46094926945363685,
 (1,): -0.06937890942745731}
```

```python
df.hess()

{(2, 2): -0.03949533176976862,
 (1, 1): 0.009158016044424365,

 (0, 0): 0.1624775219121247,
 (0, 1): -0.11260197000076322}
```
