    Faa di Bruno for vector-valued functions.
    
    Let G: K^l -> K^m and F: K^m -> K^w be two vector-valued functions. The
    goal is to compute the higher-order derivatives of the composition F o G.
    
    Assume that f = [f1, ..., fw] and g = [g1, ..., gm] represent the 
    n-jet-collections of F and G, i.e. fk = n-jet(fk_1, ..., fk_n)
    where fk_j represents the j-th derivative of the k-th component of F etc.
    
    Note that this routine requires that both f and g are represented by jetpoly
    objects in their higher-order array entries (they store the various partial derivatives
    for the given orders).
    In particular, the ordinary derive.eval routine will produce such objects. 
    This is the major difference to the one-dimensional Faa di Bruno formula 
    in njet.jet.faa_di_bruno, which has no such requirement.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    f: list
        A list of n-jet objects, representing the derivatives of the function F
        at position G(z).
        
    g: list

    Parameters
    ----------
    functions: list
        A list of callable(s) or 'derive' classes related to the
        unique vector-valued*) functions in the chain to be derived.

        Alternatively, one can pass a list of 'derive' objects, containing
        vector-valued jet evaluation output. 
        This second case can be used to avoid re-calculating the derivatives
        in circumstances where it is not required.

        Attention:
        By default, the first function is assumed to be executed first, in contrast
        to the mathematical notation. This can be changed by passing
        an 'ordering' argument (see below).

        *) This means that the functions must return iterables in any case.

        Hereby the index j must refer to the function at position j in the sequence
        of functions.

    run_params: dict, optional

    def cycle(self, *args, outf='default', **kwargs):
        r'''
        Cycle through the given chain: Compute the derivatives at each point, assuming
        a periodic structure of the entire chain.

        The basic idea goes as follows: Let c1 --> c2 --> c3 --> c4 --> c5 denote the current
        chain (in this example consisting of 5 elements). Then this routine will extend the internal
        jet-evaluation data to numpy arrays of length 5 by suitable clones and identity operators,
        so that we can compute (compose) in parallel the following chain of length 2*5 - 1:

        |  c1 ---> c2 ---> c3 ---> c4 ---> c5*
        |          c2 ---> c3 ---> c4 ---> c5 ---> c1*
        |                  c3 ---> c4 ---> c5 ---> c1 ---> c2*
        |                          c4 ---> c5 ---> c1 ---> c2 ---> c3*
        |                                  c5 ---> c1 ---> c2 ---> c3 ---> c4*

        The final results will then be returned as the starred values in the above diagram.
        
        Attention:  
        For larger cycles it may become necessary to delete any previously computed output
        of this routine in advance, in order to free up memory.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *point: float or iterable, optional
            The point at which to evaluate the derivative(s). It has to be provided if the chain has
            not yet stored any jet-evaluation data.

        periodic: boolean, optional
            If true, assume that the final point equals the given point. In particular, the
            data taken in the calculation will be taken from the current jet-evaluations (if
            it exists).

        outf: str, optional
            Output format; if 'default', compose the extended jet-evaluations and return a list of jet-evaluations,
            representing the derivatives along the chain.
            Otherwise, return a cderive object of length len(self)*2 - 1 for further processing. The
            object can be composed to yield the jet-evaluations along the current chain of len(self) in form of numpy
            arrays. This second option is intended to be used for performance improvements.

        **kwargs
            Optional keyworded arguments passed to a (possible) chain evaluation.

        Returns
        -------
        list or cderive
            Depending on the 'outf' parameter the output is either
            1) A list of jet-evaluations, where the k-th entry corresponds to the derivative of the
            chain from position k to position k + L, where L denotes the length of the chain (using
            a periodic chain structure).
            2) A cderive class with the property mentioned above.
